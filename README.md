 ## Accurate Virtual Machine Utilization Forecasting
This project aims to put into practice the search for virtual machines (VMs) inside of a target environment that meets specific parameters. The project uses a linear regression module, a custom fitness function, a Tkinter GUI, and ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel evaluation.
Python's various libraries and modules are the foundation for this entire project.
# Dependencies
* ThreadPoolExecutor
* LinearRegression
* train_test_split
* concurrent
* pandas
* os
* Tkinter
# Utilities
Once the installation is finished (download or cloning), go to the "Vm-utilipredict" folder and follow the below simple guidelines to execute main_Read_Linear.py effectively (either write the code in the command line or a Python editor).
>>> from Vm-utilipredict import main_Read_Linear
# Fitness Function
Percentage Error=( Actual Value/Actual Value−Predicted Value)×100
